        <h2>My Biography </h2>
        <p> My name is Usmael Abdurhaman Amade.I was born and raised in Hararghes's heart, and I was a very active and 
            extroverted child. I took part in a variety of events to demonstrate 
            my abilities, and I was always proactive. In my early elementary 
            school years, I was a member of the special team. After finishing 
            primary school, I enrolled in a Golia Secondary school, which provided me 
            with the opportunity to guide and assist others at a young age. I 
            was also a member of <abbr title="Quality Education For All Citizen">QEFAC</abbr>, a nonprofit organization that 
            assisted me in developing problem-solving skills connected to high school
             academics. As part of this group, I visited a number of schools, many of which
              were located outside of my hometown,
              to research student difficulties. Our goal was to obtain a deeper 
              knowledge of the problems that students confront at every level 
              so that solutions may be devised to best meet their requirements.
